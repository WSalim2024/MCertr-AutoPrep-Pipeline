# AutoPrep-Pipeline

**A modular, automated data preprocessing tool for Machine Learning workflows.**

## 📌 Overview
**AutoPrep-Pipeline** is a local automation tool designed to bridge the gap between raw, messy data and clean, model-ready datasets. Built with Python, it simulates a real-world data engineering pipeline by generating synthetic "dirty" data and passing it through a rigorous cleaning process.

This project demonstrates core competencies in:
- **Data Engineering:** Automated ingestion and handling of missing values.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Z-score outlier detection and distribution scaling.
- **Machine Learning Prep:** One-Hot Encoding for categorical feature transformation.

## ✨ Features
- **Automated Ingestion:** Loads CSV datasets seamlessly using Pandas.
- **Smart Cleaning:** Detects and handles missing values (imputation or removal).
- **Outlier Detection:** Implements Z-score analysis to identify and remove statistical outliers.
- **Normalization:** Supports Min-Max scaling and Z-score standardization.
- **Encoding:** Converts categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding.
